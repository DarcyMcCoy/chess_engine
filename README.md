# What is it?
A chess engine capable of playing chess against a human or against itself. The entire project is written in java. The engine uses a minimax algorithm to find the top move.
# Background Information
This is a personal project that I started completely for fun. However, the scale of this project continues to grow and in the future I might submit this engine to chess engine tournaments. 
This project has been and continues to be completely written by me.
